Simple specification for weather-web project

stage 1:
weather app, displaying data from different websites/apis and comparing them.
Bootstrap will be used for appearance. About page displaying some basic project
info + possibility to contact web creators/admins. Detail page for places

=> place as a model, defined by name, longtitude and latitude

add users; allow users to set and save their displayed weather forecasts
from different places. Allows users to set up a new places
=> stage 1 will work as a landing page for non-authorized users

(nice to have, further ideas):
possibility to set up an automated e-mail sending with weather information for users
